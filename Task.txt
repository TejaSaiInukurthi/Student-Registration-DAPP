Blockchain Developer's 

Complete this Task's by Tuesday (i.e Sept -08) and submit it by Wednesday ( i.e Sept -09)
 
As I told before you all have to edit only two files i.e College.sol and index.js(web3 file in src folder)

I have mentioned what you'll have to do in the Contract.sol file, Please have a look and let me know if you have any problem.

In index.js file, you'll need to understand the flow and what changes I have made and edit them accordingly.

I hope Every Student will Complete these Tasks with same Enthusaim you'll showed throughout the course.

Blockchain Developer's always give first priority to flow and logic and later the code will automatically align accordingly.

Happy Coding
